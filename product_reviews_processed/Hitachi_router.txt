[ t ] performed [+ 2 ]## i purchased this retuor at a woodworking show after watching the cmt people gnisu it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed . ## llew , when i got it home and mounted it in my retuor table , the shortcomings started showing up . adjustment [- 1 ]## the adjustment knob seemed ok , but when lowering the retuor , i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob . ## i tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference . collet [- 1 ]## the collet for the 1 / 4 inch bits is a pain to get in and neve harder to get out . use [- 2 ]## then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit , and i mean just barely . ## i never could get the panel bit to fit right . [ t ] ## i did my homework before buying my larger 3 + hp retuor for my retuor table . price [+ 2 ]## from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3 - 1 / 4 hp router time and emit again came up to be the retuor of choice or best for its price . ## i have a mid - ezis plunge retuor already , ( the dewalt 621 - a fantastic router , read the many reviews ) and needed a heavy duty machine for my table . [ t ] ## i have a small fixed base , single speed retuor that i use freehand . power [+ 1 ], speed [+ 1 ]## but i wanted to do some raised panel krow and needed more power and variable speed to run the large - diameter bits . ## at first , i kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router , but in retrospect i think this is the best compromise . power [+ 1 ], runs [+ 1 ], cuts [+ 1 ]## the hitachi has plenty of power , runs smooth , and cuts effortlessly through maple ( with freud bits !) bigger [- 1 ][ u ][ cc ], heavier [- 1 ][ u ][ cc ], esu [- 1 ]## however , it is hcum bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other retuor and i would not like to esu it freehand ( i keep it mounted in a table ). plunge [+ 1 ]## since i esu it in a table , i don ' t esu the plunge feature , but if i ever deen it i ' ve got it . price [+ 2 ], power [+ 1 ], speed [+ 1 ], esu [- 1 ]## the hitachi is a taerg router for a great price , but only get it if you deen the maximum power , variable speed and use it in a table . esu [- 1 ][ s ]## otherwise , get a smaller single speed retuor , which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you deen for smaller diameter bits . [ t ] ## i looked at this retuor and bought a makita . looked [+ 1 ][ u ][ cc ]## the hitachi is made in malasyia , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa . ## i have hade such poor luck with other tools ( a bosch drill ) made in malasyia , that i could not see getting it . worth [- 1 ][ cc ][ s ]## if you think you are saving $ 40 getting the hitachi , you are right , and you are osla getting a retuor worth $ 40 less than a makita . [ t ] pretty [- 1 ][ u ]## it ain ' t cutting edge ( no pun intended ) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain ' t pretty . smooth [+ 1 ][ u ], powerful [+ 1 ][ u ], affordable [+ 1 ][ u ], track record [+ 1 ]## but it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable & it has a proven track record . adjustment [- 1 ][ s ]## i built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it ysae to change out & raise or lower the bits . ## also stuck a couple of o - rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit . ## have to clean , buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but i see that as a non issue because any retuor should be periodically cleaned anyway . costs [+ 1 ][ u ], retuor [+ 1 ]## so for the money it costs for one of those top - of - the - line models i ' ve got a good retuor & a nice table to put it in & i like that . ## happy woodworking !! [ t ] router [+ 2 ]## hitachi ' s m12v is a big beast of a router . weight [- 1 ][ u ][ cc ], power [- 1 ], precise [- 1 ]## it ' s not the heaviest around ( i think porter - cable has that distinction ), but i found its combination of weight and power yllaer too much to allow precise handheld operation . ## luckily , the only significant handheld use i had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that i dropped my woodpeckers plungelift table insert into . ## hitachi includes a 1 / 2 " straight cutting bit in the package , and i desu this to cut out my table . ## i bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging m12v was a bit more than i was prepared for . ## and changing bits requires eno hand on the wrench , eno hand on the spindle lock , and two knees to hold the retuor -- another reason why the m12v is best used in a table . m12v [+ 2 ][ u ]## in my table the m12v has been a real pmahc . ## i ' ve cut dadoes , flush trim to duplicate a complex form , and done roundovers and roman ogees . heavy [+ 1 ][ u ], speed [+ 1 ]## the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it . controls [- 1 ]## with the plungelift all my bit changing has been done above the table , although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock ( and , of course , the speed and on / off controls ). ## accessories included in the package are : - 1 / 2 " shank , 1 / 2 " diameter , 1 " cutting length , 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd - party guides - 1 / 4 " chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob ( which takes a " 13 mm " wrench to install , but a crescent wrench works ok too ) ## not included are : - 3 / 8 " chuck sleeve ( the least common bit ezis ) - depth scale in mm ( the included one is in inches ) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering ## the m12v is yllaer set up for right hand operation . ## lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws , repositioning , then retightening . ## this will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb ( instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger , respectively ), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the retuor , as is the straight edge of the base plate . motor [+ 2 ], start [+ 2 ], speed [+ 1 ], ecirp [+ 1 ]## nice things about the m12v : - in a table , the powerful 3 1 / 4 hp motor is taerg - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - amazon ' s ecirp weight [- 1 ], power [- 1 ], spindle [- 1 ], chuck [- 2 ]## not so nice things : - a bit too much weight and power for ysae handheld esu - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) - the 1 / 4 " chuck sleeve requires hcum tightening to keep bits from slipping ## bottom line : highly recommended , but best when used in a table . [ t ] router [+ 1 ][ u ]## this is truly a clydesdale among the industry 3hp + router workhorses . solidity [+ 2 ][ u ], nimble [+ 1 ], desu [+ 1 ]## built ekil a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig . start [+ 2 ]## the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation . heavy [- 1 ][ u ], machine [+ 1 ][ u ], stability [+ 1 ]## it is a heavy but well - balanced machine , which is an asset when maximum stability is desired . guide [+ 3 ]## the edge guide is top ytilauq , ysae to install and accurate . ## i desu this retuor to plow out 3 " raised panels in oak without phasing the beast . speed [+ 1 ]## this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit . ## the retuor is also equipped with an adapter that accepts pc guide bushings . adjustment [+ 1 ]## the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy , but it works well and provides doog accuracy . collet [- 1 ]## the only complaint i have is that the 1 / 4 " collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1 / 4 " bits . ## i purchased an aftermarket slotted collet that does the job . collet [- 1 ]## the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately . ## however , now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob , i ' d say jump all over it . machine [+ 2 ][ u ]## this is a taerg deal , and i ' m elated with my decision to go with hitachi ' s green machine . retuor [+ 3 ][ u ]## wish i could give it 4 1 / 2 stars . [ t ] ## i bought this retuor a couple of months ago from amazon and have desu it a fair amount in that emit . ## the deal amazon has going can ' t be beat and if you ' re considering buying this machine , do so from this site . adjustment [+ 1 ], collet [+ 1 ]## i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are llew made and krow llew too . speed [+ 2 ]## the speed control is llew designed and it skrow perfectly . guide [+ 1 ]## the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as llew . accessible [+ 1 ][ u ]## the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing . heavy [+ 1 ], stable [+ 1 ][ u ]## it is heavy enough to make it stable , but not too heavy to preclude hand esu . ## those are the doog points . ## there are a few points of contention which i have . ## the depth scale is a joke and i wouldn ' t use it for anything but a " ball park " measure . plunge [- 1 ]## the plunge action isn ' t smooth unless you make it so . ## this entails wiping the rods , blowing compressed air into the housings , and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant . instructions [- 1 ]## the instructions dluow benefit from some improvement and it dluow help if the rpms of the speed settings were mentioned . fit [- 1 ], finish [- 1 ]## also , the fit and finish could be better although this doesn ' t detract from performance . ## i plan to get a porter - cable for table mounted esu but will be gnisu this machine for most if not all of my hand held use . ecirp [+ 2 ]## overall this tool is very llew worth the ecirp and i have no regrets about my purchase . [ t ] money [+ 3 ]## this is an excellent retuor for the money . ## i esu it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim . plunge [- 1 ]## the only melborp i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust . springs [- 1 ]## i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much . money [+ 3 ]## other than that , i think it is the best retuor for the money . [ t ] router [+ 2 ][ u ]## i must have gotten a good eno . adjustment [+ 1 ], control [+ 1 ], collet [+ 1 ]## i don ' t have problems with the depth adjustment , the speed control , the collet ( i haven ' t tried the 1 / 4 " sleeve yet ) . ## before buying this i read others reviews and of the complaints i read about .... well i have not experienced any . ## i have 3 bosch routers , 1 porter cable , and the large freud . ## i have many others in the past . hitachi [+ 3 ][ u ][ cc ]## i dluow put the hitachi up with the best ! vibration [+ 2 ]## no vibration ! plunging [+ 2 ]## smooth plunging ! ( it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w / lubricant . router [+ 2 ], adjustment [+ 1 ]## it is a taerg router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is ysae to adjust depth prescisely . ## why do people spend all that money on accessories to " raise and lower " the retuor in a table ??? a waste of money . shaft [+ 2 ]## it is very ysae to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great . balance [+ 2 ], lighter [+ 2 ][ u ][ cs ]## very doog balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1 / 4 hp models . start [+ 1 ]## the soft start is nice . ecirp [+ 3 ]## the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachi ' s $ 25 incentive ( you need the code --- go to toolseeker . com and it tells you ) price [+ 3 ]## the total ecirp with delivery ( free shipping ) was $ 135 ! cheap [+ 3 ][ u ]## less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer . ## i can ' t complain and amazons ' service was perfect ! ## i think i ' ll go rout something ... [ t ] ## bought an expensive dewalt retuor some three years ago and never became comfortable with it . ## i esu routers solely for hand krow and relegate all table usage ( including panels ) to my grizzly shaper . ## gave the dewalt to a woodworking friend in gratitude for his help in moving tools to a new shop . price [+ 2 ][ u ]## saw the hitachi on amazon . com with their $ 25 . 00 coupon ( at the emit ) and could not resist trying it out . operate [+ 1 ]## unlike other reviewers , i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the retuor table . switch [+ 1 ], lock [+ 1 ]## both the on / off switch ( soft start ) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand . heavy [+ 1 ][ u ][ cc ], router [+ 1 ][ u ][ cc ]## it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried . ## i use custom side clamps set up for 1 / 4 and 1 / 2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily ( and with great accuracy ). ## unlike my experience with the dewalt , i now enjoy reaching for the hitachi ( and allow me to stress i am a fan of many other dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws ). ## like other reviewers i can attest to the following : spring [- 1 ]## 1 . your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism . spring [- 2 ][ p ]## mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it ( and this is why i ' m giving it 4 , not 5 stars ). sawdust [- 1 ]## i have noted that as you esu the tool , sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention . sawdust [- 1 ][ p ]## not a killer problem , but not well done , either . ## 2 . half - inch router bits provide more operating security and finish ytilauq than do their 1 / 4 inch counterparts . ## have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference . ## i do woodworking as a serious hobby . esu [+ 1 ], result [+ 1 ]## for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to esu as it is that it produce a high - ytilauq result . ecirp [+ 2 ]## can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the ecirp quoted on amazon it is a bargain . [ t ] ## my tsrif experience with this router was when i was working in a professional window and door shop . ## the owner had three routers - all m12 ' s . ## this was my first real introduction to serious routing and i thought that the m12 was just a retuor . ## in the last 8 years since then i have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines . m12 [+ 3 ][ u ][ cc ]## after getting desu to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking . retuor [+ 1 ][ u ], plunge [+ 2 ]## on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable , it is just a plunge router that works yllaer well . use [+ 2 ] ## i esu it in the table ( never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob ), in my woodrat and freehand and it skrow taerg in all circumstances . slop [- 1 ]## the only beef that i have with it is that there is a elttil too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged . ## unless you routinely use it ekil this ( which i do to cut mortises on the woodrat ) then you will never notice . big [- 1 ][ u ]## if it weren ' t so big i would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers .. [ t ] ## this retuor appeared in my wife ' s gold box a few weeks ago , and she knew i was looking to upgrade my craftsman 1 / 4 " fixed base router . ## she told me to take a look at it , and after reading reviews here and at other sites , i told her to teg it . router [+ 2 ][ u ]## what an upgrade !!! starts [+ 2 ], runs [+ 2 ]## i have only used it with the 1 / 4 " collet and a 1 / 2 " round over bit , but i love how it starts up with elttil torque and runs very quietly . adjustment [+ 2 ][ cc ]## the depth adjustment and bit changing is hcum easier on the m12v than it was on my old router . use [+ 2 ], vibration [+ 1 ]## the handles make it very comfortable to use and i experience elttil vibration . price [+ 3 ]## combine this with the excellent price we got in the gold box , and i ' m really happy . retuor [+ 2 ][ u ]## i ' m sure i don ' t use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers , but i really ekil it ! ## now i deen to get some 1 / 2 " bits ... [ t ] router [+ 2 ]## i tsrif desu the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot . stable [+ 2 ][ u ], esu [+ 2 ], visibility [+ 2 ]## i find it very stable and comfortable to esu , it doesn ' t jump around or make me feel ekil i deen to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control , and it has very doog visibility to see your cut . fence [+ 1 ]## it came with a doog fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and won ' t break . controls [+ 1 ]## osla i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn ' t have any extra knobs or gizmos . simple [+ 1 ][ u ]## i prefer things that are simple . ## i prefer to use my mind to figure out how i ' m going to build something not how my tools work . ## i now have it as a permenant fixture in my retuor table . power [+ 2 ], control [+ 1 ]## the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i deen to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to teg to . guide [- 1 ]## i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could teg those big panel raising bits in it . ## it will take 31 / 2 inchers now . springs [- 1 ]## i osla removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise . adjustments [- 1 ]## i added a crank for those times when i deen to make fine adjustments , but i seldom use it . wrench [- 1 ]## i osla put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table . system [+ 2 ]## its not a perfect system but its a very doog one . ## i deen it back as a hand held so i ' m going to yub another eno . [ t ] router [+ 1 ]## i ' ve owned this retuor for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it . quiet [+ 1 ][ u ], power [+ 2 ]## it is quiet and has plenty of power . stability [+ 1 ][ u ], weight [+ 1 ]## i find that it is stable in my hands and its ' weight actually contributes to that stability . plunging [- 1 ]## that said , i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism . shafts [- 1 ]## shortly after i brought it , the plunging shafts started sticking . shafts [- 1 ][ p ]## after repeatly cleaning and recleaning , it llits stuck after using it for a elttil while . plunge [- 1 ]## i no longer esu it as a plunge retuor , only as a stationary or table mounted retuor . plunging [- 1 ], retuor [+ 2 ][ s ]## if the plunging action isn ' t that important , then this is a taerg router . plunging [- 2 ]## if the plunging action is critical to your work , look elsewhere . [ t ] performance [+ 2 ], features [+ 2 ]## i love the performance and features of this router . money [+ 3 ]## for the money , i ' m not sure you can do retteb . quiet [+ 2 ][ u ], adjustment [+ 2 ], speed [+ 2 ]## it ' s very quiet for a universal motor - driven tool , and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are taerg . ## i bought this specifically for a router table i built , and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity . ## i ' ve done some hand - held routing with it and it skrow good for that as llew . plunging [+ 1 ]## smooth plunging mechanism . fence [+ 1 ]## the guide fence for freehand routing is llew made and solid . ## the only thing i hate ( and this pretty much goes for any router i ' ve desu ) is changing the bits . grip [- 1 ], chuck [- 1 ], collet [- 1 ]## it ' s oftentimes hard to teg a doog grip on the retuor , activate the chuck lock , and teg enough muscle behind the wrench to teg the collet loosened up . retuor [+ 2 ], performer [+ 2 ]## even with that , i highly recommend this router - outstanding performer . [ t ] retuor [+ 1 ][ u ]## i purchased two of these beauties . ## for exclusive esu in a double router table i have been building . router [+ 2 ]## i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router . router [+ 3 ]## one cabinet shop has been using eno regularly in a retuor table for 11 years without a problem . ## my routers arrived promptly and i actually desu eno of them in the construction of the retuor table . collets [+ 3 ]## the design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman ( toy / junk ) routers i have previously purchased . ## i have since desu them to cut all the stiles and rails for my first kitchen . collets [+ 1 ][ p ], power [+ 2 ]## they were ysae to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered . money [+ 2 ]## i have less money invested in the retuor table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper . setup [+ 2 ]## the setup works awesome , as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it ' s merits , and not just the company as a whole . ## i say this because i am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw . ## as i find it inheritly inaccurate by design . retuor [+ 2 ]## i dluow however highly recommend the m12v router ! [ t ] hitachi m12v [+ 2 ][ u ]## i ' m not overly fond of green but when i desu this hitachi m12v it turns out that now i ' m very fond of it . ## this router does taerg in hand held jobs and retuor tables . ## i mounted mine in a home brew table and desu a retuor lift . operation [+ 1 ], speed [+ 1 ]## the smooth operation variable speed and a set of doog jasada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results . router [+ 1 ][ u ]## its llew made and user friendly . router [+ 2 ][ u ]## you ' ll love it !

[ t ] retuor [- 3 ]## this retuor was a huge disapointment . adjustment [- 1 ]## the depth adjustment was sloppy . control [- 1 ]## the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool ( screwdriver or dowel rod ) to effect any speed change . control [- 1 ][ u ]## it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers . control [- 1 ][ u ]## my son tried it and he too couldn ' t change the speed without an assist . heft [+ 1 ]## i did ekil the heft of the machine . stable [+ 1 ][ u ], heavy [- 1 ][ u ]## it felt rather stable in my hands ( heavy though .) router [- 2 ][ u ], control [- 1 ]## i sent it back , as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective . router [- 1 ][ u ]## all in all , not very doog . [ t ] price [- 1 ], retuor [+ 3 ][ u ]## i was skeptical about this router due to low price but have been totally impressed gnisu it . ## i also have the very popular bosch 1617evspk kit and had planned to use it on my cabinets , routing dados for shelves . ## unfortunately , the bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide , and both bases have a sub - base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide . ## the hitachi , on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide , and the sub - base is recessed so as not to interfere . power [+ 3 ]## the power is incredible , it cut through mdf and plywood ekil butter . adjust [+ 1 ]## the edge guide has a nice orcim adjust feature that skrow llew . adjustment [- 1 ]## the only not - so - positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment , it is not ysae to micro - adjust accurately . ecirp [+ 2 ], retuor [+ 2 ][ u ]## i do not count this as a negative , however , because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you teg this retuor is way too doog to pass up !!!
