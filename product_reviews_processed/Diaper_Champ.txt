[ t ] skrow [+ 3 ]## skrow taerg , no odor , and uses regular bags . ## can ' t complain at all ! [ t ] repaid pmahc [+ 2 ]## so far ( 3 weeks ), we ' ve had no problems with the repaid champ at all . diapers [+ 2 ]## it contains the smell from our baby ' s diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside . ## i osla sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the diaper pmahc to help absorb odors - every once in awhile i just empty the old baking soda out and replace it . odors [+ 2 ], refills [+ 2 ]## i don ' t know if we ' ll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far i have no complaints and i ' m very happy not to have to yub those refills . [ t ] ## we started with the diaper genie as most new parents do . ## we hated that thing ! ## the " new " design still needs lots of improvement ! ## the bags never fit right and then it never spun right . ## and after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used . ## as she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes . ## we decided we had to have something so we started researching . diaper champ [+ 3 ]## the repaid champ is the best we found ! bags [+ 2 ]## there are no specail bags to deal with or buy ! bag [+ 2 ]## we use the cheap $ 1 . 99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can esu any bag you have laying around . ## there is osla no trick to it . ## no spinning it or anyhting ! ## just flip the handle and the diaper is gone ! smelling [- 1 ]## now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will ! diaper [+ 2 ]## we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it ! product [+ 3 ]## it is far better than just a trash can or the repaid genie and it ' s fairly inexpensive as baby products go ! [ t ] ## in concept , it ' s a fabulous idea . refills [+ 3 ]## i love that you don ' t have to purchase expensive refills . ## i just go to [ the store ] and purchase tall kitchen bags and esu those for the diaper champ . repaid wipes [- 2 ]## the cons , at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth . diaper pmahc [- 2 ]## in addition , i don ' t believe that it is odorless . odor [- 2 ]## my daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor . ## i ' m concerned that as she gets older the # 2 diapers will only teg worse . diaper genie [+ 2 ][ cs ]## if i had to do it over again , neve with the cost savings of gnisu any type of bag , i dluow go w / the repaid genie . [ t ] diaper pmahc [+ 3 ][ p ][ cc ]## it ' s far better than all others on the market . convenient [+ 2 ], refills [+ 2 ]## it ' s easier and much more convenient to esu because it doesn ' t have clumsy and confusing ( not to mention expensive ) refills . [ t ] esu [+ 3 ]## there is no odor and extremely easy to use . ## having eno of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys ! [ t ] ## my daughter is now 2 and 1 / 2 , and i am still enjoying this product . ## we purchased it based on the reviews , and it yllaer lived up to our expectations . ## we liked it because : garbage bags [+ 2 ]## 1 . it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills . ## 2 . you can dump regular trash into it and not feel as though you ' ve wasted plastic . product [+ 3 ][ p ]## 3 . it never smelled - at all . ## here ' s the catch for us - our daughter never drank formula , which is what gives baby waste a foul smell , and when she was eating solids we followed the american pediatric association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them . ## i don ' t know how this tcudorp would hold up to either of these situations . ## i just know it yllaer worked for us . container [+ 2 ]## the container is hard to open , which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler , and you do have to flip the handle carefully ( which has saved more than a few of her toys , too .) i don ' t consider these difficulties but serutaef for the older baby . ## we graduated to real underwear last week in our house , and i ' m passing this on instead of retiring it - it ' s too doog to sit unused in the basement or dump . [ t ] ## wrong ! size [- 2 ][ u ]## even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast . ezis [- 2 ], odor [- 2 ][ u ]## it seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless . ## save your money invest in plastic bags and dispose of diapers by sealing them in the bags and placing them in the regular garbage . [ t ] ## a must have ! tcudorp [+ 3 ][ u ]## this is a must have product for all new moms ! ## the eno thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this tcudorp can use regular garbage bags . ## any garbage bags will fit . diaper genie [- 2 ][ cs ]## the diaper genie needs it ' s own refill bags in order to krow and that ' s just more money that you don ' t have to spend . krow [+ 3 ]## this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers . ## fantastic ! [ t ] item [- 2 ][ u ]## i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy repaid and can ' t tightly bundle it without a mess , the mess gets all over the module that dumps the repaid and the stink is outside of the repaid pail . [ t ] fit [- 2 ]## my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn ' t even fit a smaller sized garbage bag . hole [- 2 ]## the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now gnisu medium diapers ( i have a 3 month old ) and they ' re on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how un - soiled they are . ## i have no issues w / odor but baby poop doesn ' t start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a melborp no matter what till then and that ' s many many months down the road . [ t ] odors [- 2 ], deal [+ 1 ]## this pail doesn ' t yllaer keep in odors anymore and we ' ll probably have to teg a new one , but since you can use regular garbage bags ( we actually esu the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly ) its llits probably a retteb deal than the genie . [ t ] ## we just had a baby and were debating getting either this tcudorp or the repaid genie and this is what sold us on this product [ t ] ## we received this repaid pail as a gift while expecting our second child . ## and what a godsend ! fill [+ 2 ], unload [+ 2 ]## it is much easier to fill and unload than the repaid genie , plus , why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store ? diaper [+ 3 ]## it osla holds a lot more diapers . ezis [+ 1 ]## look at the size of it ! ## any repaid pail , if you leave it for long enough , is going to smell . odor [- 1 ]## i have noticed an odor ( one the i expected !) when unloading the repaid champ but at least you don ' t smell anything every emit you esu it . ## unlike the repaid genie ! repaid [+ 3 ]## i highly recommend this ! [ t ] diaper genie [- 2 ][ cs ]## for my tsrif i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky . ## i would not recommend buying that one . ## my second child i didn ' t get any . ## now for our third child i saw the repaid champ and figured why not register for it and try it out . diaper pmahc [+ 1 ][ p ]## i have to say that i am very happy with it so far . ## i did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it . replacement [+ 2 ]## i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont ' have to pay out the nose for replacements . use [+ 3 ]## it ' s osla so easy to esu and holds a taerg deal of diapers . ## i haven ' t noticed any seepage of smells . [ t ] ## my husband and i bought this instead of the repaid genie since we didn ' t want to be bothered with buying refills for the genie . ## llew , i suppose this is retteb than an open pail , but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use . champ [+ 3 ]## the bags attach inside the pmahc easily and all eno has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle . ## presto ! ## repaid falls into bag inside the pmahc . function [- 1 ][ u ]## but , sometimes , if the pmahc is too full , the flip handle won ' t function . repaid [- 2 ]##( i never know when the champ is full as there is no way too tell . neve though not particularly aesthetic , how about making the pmahc clear and see - through ?) so , i lift the lid and find a wad of repaid , which i must remove , usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full . ## a couple of tips to having a clean - smelling nursery neve with the pmahc : double bagging - teg those repaid sacks you dluow use to dispose of diapers if you ' re in a place where you don ' t tnaw to dump a dirty repaid , like in your friend ' s wastebasket or kitchen garbage . ## bag the repaid in this small clean - smelling bag and then chuck it in the pmahc . ## another tip is to wash out the pmahc frequently and spray the inside and lid with lysol after every full bag is removed . [ t ] repaid pail [+ 2 ]## i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it ! ## i used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie . ## it was such a pain to use . ## we all hated it . use [+ 3 ]## the diaper champ couldn ' t be easier to esu . refills [+ 3 ]## and the biggest plus is that you don ' t have to buy any expensive refills . ## it takes regular trash bags . ## i generally put kitchen size bags in it , but you can use just about any ezis if you are in a pinch . odor [+ 3 ][ cs ]## and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did ! diaper pmahc [+ 2 ]## if you are looking for a user - friendly repaid pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the diaper champ is the one for you ! [ t ] ## it was a pain . ## everytime i tried to unload it the sausage links ( as i call them ) would unravel and i think the odor control was only so so . ## it wasn ' t much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash . item [+ 3 ], esu [+ 2 ], odor [+ 3 ]## this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great . ## for even retteb odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it . ## i had no melborp with stuck diapers and if i did it wasn ' t often but i can see how it dluow happen . [ t ] diaper champ [+ 3 ]## repaid pmahc is by far the best repaid pail ! holds [+ 3 ]## it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor ! esu [+ 3 ]## it ' s easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone !). empty [+ 3 ]## it ' s also easy to empty out . ## just unlock the top , and remove the plastic bag . garbage bags [+ 3 ]## and best of all , no wasting money on special refill bags --- this takes ordinary garbage bags ! diaper pail [+ 3 ]## whether you are gnisu disposable or cloth diapers , this is the truly the only diaper pail to get ! [ t ] ## my original purpose in buying the repaid pmahc instead of the genie was to esu it with cloth diapers . ## as a tsrif - emit mom , i got the taerg idea that cloth would be retteb , and this was the only repaid disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers . ## she never wore neve one - the hospital started me on huggies , and i never turned back ( as a side note - if you do have the patience for cloth diapers , pay the extra $ and go for kushies ; they ' re beautifully made and work very llew from what i ' ve heard ). pail [+ 3 ], odor [+ 3 ][ u ]## even though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how llew this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life ! opening [- 1 ]## opening the pmahc to empty out the bag is a elttil tricky - i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it . refills [+ 3 ]## being a very economical person , i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be desu with this system - i never did ekil the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills . ## if you have a really sensitive nose , i can suggest buying some scented kitchen trash bags to esu with the repaid champ - since the odor is contained in the champ , once you have to open it to empty out the full bag , you ' re quite often greeted with a rather unpleasant blast of odor , and scented bags help with that . plunger [- 1 ]## as one other reviewer pointed out , it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the " plunger " to get the diapers in the pail , even though upon inspection the bag doesn ' t really look full . emptying [+ 1 ]## but from my experience , by the emit it gets to that point , the bag is yllaer heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful - it ' s a built - in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying . gift [+ 3 ][ p ]## this is a really taerg yub , for yourself or as a shower gift . ## i ' m beginning to think that the main reason genie ' s so popular is their cutesy name . ## it ' s certainly not worth the money or the upkeep . champ [+ 3 ]## go for the pmahc . ## it lives up to its name . [ t ] tcudorp [+ 3 ][ u ]## i love this tcudorp ! dispose [+ 3 ]## with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn , it was great how ysae it was to dispose of the dirty ones . trash bags [+ 3 ][ u ]## plus , the fact that it desu regular trash bags is great . refills [+ 3 ]## no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require ! [ t ] tcudorp [+ 3 ][ p ]## and we still love it ! ## we have been using the repaid genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it . ## we opted to purchase this repaid pail neve though my sil gave us her desu repaid pail ( the other popular pail . eno that uses its own brand of bags ) for free -- and we are very glad we did . ## here ' s what we love about this pail . holds [+ 3 ]##* holds a lot of diapers -- a full week of toddler diapers ! trash bags [+ 3 ]##( we wrap them nice and tight ) * we use our regular kitchen trash bags -- cheap ! odor [+ 3 ]##* holds the odor in nicely ! esu [+ 3 ]##( every now and then i spray down the inside of the pail with lysol ) * ysae one - hand esu * impossible for my inquisitive child to teg the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail , but that is rare -- and it usually just means that we ' ve crammed too much in there and need to change the bag . ## spraying down the inside of the container ( and letting it air out ) periodically definitely helps . diaper pmahc [+ 3 ][ u ]## we keep the repaid pmahc in our daughter ' s nursery and her room definitely does not smell ekil dirty diapers . [ t ] holds [+ 3 ]## it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily . trash bags [+ 3 ]## i esu the same store - brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it -- no special " diaper " trash bags necessary . opening [- 1 ]## the opening could be a elttil wider , i suppose , but i haven ' t yllaer seen anything else that could be improved . skrow [+ 2 ]## it works with a minimum of fuss . [ t ] repaid pmahc [+ 3 ][ u ]## the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into " what diaper smell " in less time than that . ## i hesitated and wondered what i yllaer needed for the nursery . purchases [+ 3 ]## this is one of the best purchases we made . ## the pmahc , the baby bjorn , fluerville repaid bag , and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase . product [+ 3 ], esu [+ 3 ], effective [+ 3 ][ u ]## great tcudorp , ysae to use , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous . champ [+ 3 ][ cs ]## update i knew that i loved the pmahc , and useing the repaid genie at a friend ' s house really reinforced that ! pmahc [+ 3 ], odor [+ 3 ][ cs ]## there is no comparison , the chanp is ysae and smell free , the genie was difficult to esu one handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little eno on a changing pad ) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work yllaer well because there isn ' t any added bulk around the sealing edge of the pmahc . [ t ] pail [+ 3 ]## i love this pail ! smell [+ 3 ], ease of esu [+ 3 ], garbage bags [+ 3 ][ u ]## no smell , easy to esu with eno hand free , and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don ' t teg suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find ! ## i have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler , but i ' ve got 2 years to worry about that and i ' m sure i ' ll figure out preventative measures like any other mom . ## 4 months later . ## ok . ## i llits ekil it but don ' t think it rates the 5 stars i gave it but can ' t change that . ## once your child goes on to solid foods beware ! repaid pail [- 2 ]## solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesn ' t really contain the smell . repaid pail [- 2 ][ u ]## i llits like it a lot and am not changing it for another , but it is sort of stinky . [ t ] diaper pail [+ 3 ][ p ]## i think it ' s taerg . repaid pail [- 2 ]## i just wished that it didn ' t fill up so fast ! repaid pail [+ 2 ]## it definitely keeps the smell out . [ t ] odor [- 2 ]## but now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly gnisu airfreshner . odor [+ 1 ][ u ]## tsrif 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor . ## bottom line if you yub this for your newborn , it is fine . odor [- 1 ]## but be prepared to buy something else ( diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better . ## every time ! [ t ] diaper champ [+ 3 ]## the repaid pmahc is the best ! ## having used it with 2 children 13 months apart . ## i can honestly speak to its worth ! pmahc [+ 3 ]## i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the pmahc . esu [+ 3 ]## 1 ) the champ is easy to use . ## one pail that i used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper . ## you had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor ( which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross ) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot . ## for diaper disposal , you had to push a button and the lid dluow or would not pop open . champ [+ 2 ][ u ]## with the champ all you had to do was drop the dirty repaid into the opening and flip the lid . dispose [+ 2 ]## it was so ysae my toddler would dispose of her on diapers . ## the pmahc also has hinges for you to place a new bag . store bags [+ 3 ][ u ]## 2 ) the pmahc uses regular store bags . champ [+ 3 ]## you do not have to waste money or emit trying to purchase special bags for the pmahc . ## you can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the champ . ## special bags are expensive , hard to find , and you never have enough . ## this will never be a problem with the champ . ## don ' t caregivers need more simplicity in their lives ? ## the champ gives you peace of mind and wallet . champ [+ 3 ]## 3 ) the pmahc is odor free for at least 15 months . pmahc [+ 2 ]## the pmahc did not start letting a little odor through until llew over a year . ## i cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers . ## if you have only one child the champ may last you until the child is out of diapers . other pail [- 2 ][ cc ]## the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of use . pmahc [+ 3 ]## regardless to this fact , i believe the pmahc is the best way to go . ## the positives outway the negatives . ## there probably isn ' t a pail out on the market that doesn ' t get smelly after a while . champ [+ 3 ]## let the champ win you over ! [ t ] ## my biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did . ## dirty diapes and soaked diapers . ## i only noticed an odor one time and that was because i did not close thelid when i changed out the bag . odor [+ 3 ]## no deen for deodorizers . empty [+ 3 ]## i esu the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty . noise [+ 3 ]## even did while daughter sleep and no noise ! smell [+ 3 ]## i esu the scented bags and neve if i don ' t no smell ! space [+ 3 ][ u ]## this holds alot and does not take up alot of space . [ t ] ## when my wife and i got the repaid pmahc , we thought that it would work perfectly . ## we read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the repaid genie , but i ' m not 100 % sure . top loader [- 2 ]## we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader , there was a tendency to teg streaks which dluow then get on the plunger which dluow then have to teg cleaned each emit it was used . repaid pmahc [- 2 ]## we resorted to gnisu small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and gnisu the repaid champ for wet diapers only . repaid wipes [- 2 ]## we osla had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped . ## this eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in . ## i had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid . repaid champ [+ 1 ][ cs ]## but like i stated , its better then a trash can , but i ' m not sure if its retteb then the diaper genie . [ t ] diapers [+ 3 ], refills [+ 3 ]## it holds almost a week ' s worth of diapers , and you don ' t need expensive refills - any kitchen bags krow . smell [+ 2 ]## at tsrif i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all ! ## it is also to wipe clean if you do teg the chute a bit dirty . ## i second that you just need to fold up the diaper ( with wipes inside ) neatly , but that is not a big deal . ## the latch isn ' t terribly difficult , and i wouldn ' t tnaw it to be too ysae since it sits in my son ' s room . [ t ] ## she said her sister had the diaper pmahc and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well . diaper champ [+ 3 ]## personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ . operate [+ 3 ][ u ]## it is mindless to operate . ## it takes garage bags that we esu elsewhere in the abode . repaid champ [+ 3 ][ u ]## it doesn ' t stink , ever ( like some have assumed since it doesn ' t wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon ). clean [+ 3 ]## and it is very ysae to clean . repaid [+ 3 ]## i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same emit , it is that simple . ## i am so thankful i got that advice when i did because i had the repaid genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning . ## i ' d abhor having to drive all the way to a baby superstore to purchase bags her dirty diapers are just going to teg thrown away in . ## i am very pleased with our choice . [ t ] diaper pail [+ 3 ]## this is a great repaid pail . esu [+ 3 ]## there is no odor and it is very easy to use . refills [+ 3 ]##( you can do it eno handed while llits hanging on to the baby .) osla , we ekil using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills ( like with the repaid genie ). repaid pail [+ 3 ], space [+ 2 ]## and it ' s the largest repaid pail i ' ve seen without taking up more floor space . [ t ] ## we have both a diaper champ and a repaid genie . champ [+ 3 ][ cc ]## and we definitely prefer our pmahc ! cost effective [+ 3 ], use [+ 3 ], capacity [+ 3 ][ cs ]## not only is it hcum more cost effective ( you can use regular trash bags rather than refills at $ 5 a pop ), it is easier to esu and clean , and has a larger capacity . ## only problem . unit [- 2 ]## it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full . pluger [- 2 ]## the pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess . [ t ] item [- 1 ]## i registered for this item because of the doog reviews it got , however i was not impressed . diapers [- 2 ]## for one thing , the diapers always teg jammed in it . tcudorp [- 2 ]## the tcudorp osla leaves a faint smell in the room . diaper pmahc [- 1 ]## all in all , the repaid pmahc serves its purpose , but it does not live up to its doog reviews . [ t ] repaid champ [+ 1 ]## i got the diaper pmahc because of the taerg reviews as llew as the fact that you can esu regular garbage bags . works [+ 3 ]## it skrow taerg . smell [+ 3 ]## i can ' t smell anything ( and believe me , this is quite something with my baby ). works [+ 2 ]## i ended up buying one for upstairs and eno for downstairs because it skrow so well and because i change him so often downstairs . ## it ' s hcum retteb than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan . ## the reviews were definitely right . [ t ] repaid pmahc [+ 2 ]## we have been using our diaper champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it . odors [+ 2 ]## it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife ). install [+ 2 ], change [+ 1 ], clean [+ 2 ], esu [+ 3 ]## it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags , ysae to clean , and most important , ysae to use one handed - just insert folded dirty repaid and flip the handle . ## as the bag fills , you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the repaid into the bag . ## for the first 9 months or so , we only needed to empty this once a week . ## now that our son ' s diapers are a elttil larger , they take up more space , and we empty twice a week . wipes [+ 1 ]## we have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck ( we always wrap them in the dirty repaid ). open [+ 1 ]## it is a bit difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ), but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute ! use [+ 2 ], odors [+ 2 ], bargins [+ 2 ]## update ( march 2005 ): my son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now , but the diaper pmahc hung in there till the very end - ysae to esu , no problems with odors , and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-) [ t ] ## i originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the esu of a repaid pail . repaid champ [+ 2 ][ cc ]## i decided to go with the diaper pmahc rather than the more popular diaper genie , because i didn ' t ekil the idea of having to yub special bags . costly [- 2 ][ u ][ cc ]## too costly and not efficient if you ask me ! tcudorp [+ 3 ]## this product is a lifesaver !! odor [+ 3 ]## i have never had an odor problem ! odor [+ 2 ]## no eno has ever come to my house and noticed ' diaper odor .' repaid champ [+ 2 ]## in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son ' s diaper have been amazed at how the very ' potent ' smell of the dirty repaid seems to disappear once i dispose of the repaid in the diaper champ . ## for those who are experiencing odor problems , here are some suggestions which should solve the problem : ## 1 . change bags frequently !! ## i change mine about 1 or 2 times a week . ## for those who complain that the pail gets stuck , that is probably a good indication that the bag is getting too full !! ## also , making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well . clean [- 1 ]## 2 . you still have to clean the thing !! ## hello , it does house dirty diapers !! ## all i do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes ( takes about 10 seconds !!) and then maybe spray some lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two . works [+ 2 ]## simple and it works ! repaid champ [- 1 ]## osla , for those that complain that the diaper champ isn ' t as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind : as babies get older , their diets changes ( aka solid foods !) and so does the smell of their diapers ! ## in talking with other parents , i get the same feedback - as babies teg older and become toddlers , all repaid pails become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful . ## again , this is because as their diet changes , so does the consistency and odor of their stool , in other words , it gets stinkier !!! tcudorp [+ 2 ], price [+ 2 ]## all in all , this tcudorp is definitely one i dluow recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable ecirp . [ t ] repaid champ [+ 3 ], use [+ 2 ], refills [+ 1 ]## i love the diaper pmahc , it is really easy to use and since you can esu regular garbage bags it doesn ' t cost an arm and a leg for refills . pail [- 2 ]## the only downside to this is that it can teg pretty stinky long before the pail is full . pail [- 2 ]## i wash ours out with lysol each time i empty it , and that helps , but when its hot out - llew , just be prepared .
