[ t ] router [+ 2 ]## this router does everything that it is supposed to do , so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it . setup [+ 2 ], installation [+ 2 ] ## it was a very quick setup and installation , in fact the disc that it comes with pretty hcum makes sure you cant mess it up . install [+ 3 ]## by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the retupmoc and it tells you what to do . skrow [+ 3 ] ## it skrow great , i am usually at the full 54 mbps , although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is . ## that only happens every so often , but its not that big of a drawback yllaer , just a little slower than usual . retuor [+ 2 ][ p ] ## it really is a taerg yub if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house . router [+ 2 ] ## there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this retuor , and everybody is happy with it . ## i do not really know why some people are tearing this retuor ! ## apart on their reviews , they are talking about installation problems and what not . setup [+ 2 ], retuor [+][ s ] ## its the easiest thing to setup i thought , and i am only 16 ... so with all that said , yub the router !!!! [ t ] install [- 2 ], router [+ 1 ] ## it ' s probably a fine retuor , but i found the install wizard to be of poor ytilauq . ## if you have good networking knowledge , you ' ll abandon the wizard , esu the 100 - page online manual , and be fine . ## i know more about networking than 70 % of the consumers out there , so i was able to puzzle my way through it , but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages . wizard [- 2 ][ u ] ## the wizard is particularly sinister . wizard [- 2 ]## it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre - existing router ( mine does ), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard - wired pc or a wireless equipped pc . ## after asking for a password ( is it asking me to set a password or am i supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is " admin "?) it refused to go past step 8 . ## these are just some of the pathetic examples . ## they ! ## provide no printed manual . ## i had downloaded the 112 page manual from the linksys website . ## stupid me . ## it turns out to be copyright 2002 and hcum inferior to the 2005 manual included on the cd . ## but can you decide to access the cd manual once you have started the wizard ? ## no , of course not . ## you have to completely exit the wizard and re - start the cd in order to find the " user guide " tab which loads the manual . setup [- 2 ] ## the box proudly displays " secureeasysetup ( tm )" " wireless made simple " " eno touch setup button " " ysae start " " ysae security " " ysae everyday " apparently linksys / cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial . ## it just doesn ' t follow through in any consumer - tested way . ## i don ' t know if netgear , d - link , etc are any better . [ t ] ## if you ' re buying this product and operate on a mac platform , ditch the cd and go directly to live assistance on the linksys website . retuor [+ 2 ] ## i recently bought the linksys wrt54g retuor and have been very happy with the retuor itself . ## i run on mac osx , and though i considered getting the whole apple airport setup , the cost difference between the airport and the latest model linksys pretty much left no comparison . ##( the airport was more than twice the linksys retuor .) configuration [- 2 ][ cc ] ## however , configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours , and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup . ## i am a generally retupmoc - savvy person ; not an it expert by any means ( which is what retuor configuration sometimes seems to require ), but i can install and manage most retupmoc stuff without too much support . ## but wh ! ## en i opened the box i found elttil more than a few advertisement flyers and instructions to run the enclosed cd before plugging in the router . cd [- 1 ] ## too bad they don ' t mention anything about how the cd can ' t be desu with a mac . ##( didn ' t find that out until i talked to someone in technical support an hour later . ##) after messing about a bit with the cd , i went online to the linksys site to look for support tips . user manual [- 2 ] ## i even downloaded the tcudorp ' s user manual - useless . technical support [- 2 ] ## the linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the retuor for esu with a mac . ## it ' s like they want to pretend that apple doesn ' t exist or something . ## but eventually i found my way to live assistance through their site ( thank goodness ), where someone was able to give me adequate instructions to configure the router so that i could at least esu it . instruction [- 2 ] ## i say adequate because it was enough to teg wireless working , but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that i could have done if so ! ## meone dluow just give me some instructions in plain english . ## the router comes with a ton of options for setup , but sadly enough , i had no idea what most of it meant . documentation [- 2 ] ## what this product yllaer needs is retteb documentation for how to set up the retuor for different operating systems ! ##! and step by step explanations for all the different setup options and their relevance . ## i don ' t mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box , but please have some instructions * somewhere . setup [- 2 ] ##* i ' m giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable . product [+ 3 ][ p ] ## but the tcudorp iself is taerg . ## if you have a mac , i don ' t think you should totally discount this tcudorp . router [+ 3 ][ p ] ## once you set it up , it ' s great . well - priced [+ 2 ] ## and it is extremely llew - priced for what you ' re getting . ## just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup , and invite some computer - savvy friends over first if you ' re prone to high blood pressure . [ t ] ## for an item that is not neve available in best buy and the other major stores when i went to yub it , the fact that ... has these in and out of stock , and that i received it in only a couple of days is knowledge enough to make this a winning situation . ## what about hookup and use ? performance [+ 3 ][ u ] ## another 5 star performance . ## having never hooked up a wireless network before , i took the advice of the quick start guide that came with the unit , and desu their included cd . ## they strongly recommended that you use the cd rather than manually configure , and they were right . ## having seen the problems that some others were having with setup , only to be resolved ( some of them ) by exactly following the directions , i decided to do it that way right out of the box . ## i ' m glad i did . cd [+ 3 ] ## this setup using the cd was about as ysae as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the tsrif emit . ## shutting off what they t ! ## ell you to shut off , and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on , resulted in a delightful install . ## not neve eno glitch . ## the cd determined my internet connection , determined my system configuration , asked me a few questions , and bingo i was up and running . ## i bought the pc card for laptops as llew , and that was just as easy to install . ## within 10 minutes i was surfing the web from all over the house . ## no wires ! speed [+ 3 ] ## pertaining to the speed issue : i got 54mps while i was in the same room . ## when i went into the living room , it went to very doog instead of excellent , and gave me 37mbps . ## let ' s get a perspective here . ## a standard modem skrow at 56k tops . works [+ 3 ] ## this router skrow at 54mbps that ' s megabyte not kilobyte . ## their are 1000 kilobytes in every megabyte . ## so 54 megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem . running [+ 3 ] ## i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobytes on the download e ! ## nd , and 100 to 150 upload speed . ## i know i am getting specific , but the point i am making is that it does not matter what the connection speed you are running at any given moment , based on how close the base unit is to the pc card . ## what is important is that your internet connection will never neve approach the speed capabilities of this router , so don ' t hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network . broadband [+ 3 ] ## broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies . ## as soon as you click on a site , it appears on the screen . ## anyhow , just for reference , i am using a dell inspiron notebook , hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by comcast . ## the operating system is windows xp . installation [+ 3 ] ## installation was as near automatic as can be . ## they do supply instructions when using windows me , 98 etc , that includes one more step than xp . equipment [+ 3 ]## all in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment . ## follow the directions exactly . ## it is ysae . ## hope this helps . [ t ] wep encryption [- 1 ] ## i had some issues when i had enabled wep encryption and then moved on to wpa . ## ironically , the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue .... so now i have no problems what so ever . connectivity [+ 2 ] ## even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity . firmware update [+ 2 ] ## new firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration . configuration [+ 2 ] ## all you have to do is click eno button on the retuor configuration window and the retuor automatically senses the devices and configures the network . router [+ 3 ][ u ] ## awesome for the newbie , though i personally ekil to fasten every bolt myself . installation [+ 2 ] ## comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router . setting up [+ 3 ] ## you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network . costlier [- 1 ][ u ] ## linksys is more costlier than others and is a home / consumer division of cisco . ## but i believe for stability , this extra ecirp is worth spending . ## whatever you do , please don ' t go for a netgear . ! [ t ] ## it did not take me that long to set this up , but it did require * not * following the instructions . ## i had an old wired linksys retuor . ## the new wireless retuor contained large warnings to run the cd tsrif before trying to connect it . ## there was a big sticker inside the box saying " run cd tsrif - do not disconnect your current retuor ". ## and the router itself had protective tape over the ethernet inputs . ## so i ran the cd , but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old , so the cd s / w did not recognize it . instructions [- 2 ][ u ] ## there were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual , it did not give an answer readily on what do to . ## if i did not know anything about networking whatsoever , i might be stumped at this point . ## but since i do have a little experience , i simply disconnected my old retuor and put in the new eno . ## i do know what wires go ! ## to which inputs , i know what the lights mean , etc . ## so then running the cd , everything worked out ok to connect my wired computers again . security [- 2 ] ## the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection . ## there was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the retuor was secured . ## if i did not know what to do , i ' d have no idea how to connect wirelessly . ## but knowing that the ip for my previous linksys router was 192 . 162 . 1 . 1 , i went there and found a drop down screen that had the information ( the security key ) i needed to connect my wireless laptop . works [+ 2 ] ## the router works fine for both wired and wireless . connect [+ 3 ][ u ] ## i can go pretty far away from my router and llits connect wirelessly . connect [+ 2 ][ u ] ## overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s / w worked well to connect . ## but if you did not know what to do , you might have to call linksys . ## i would suggest for linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with ! cd [- 2 ][ u ] ## elttil to no networking experience , just in case the automatic cd method has issues . retuor [+ 2 ][ p ] ## i ' d give it 4 . 5 stars if possible , but since 5 stars would be misleading , i give it 4 stars . [ t ] ## here is the big news to everyone ; this is a consumer level product . enterprise piece [- 3 ][ u ] ## this is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment . ## you will not be able to run 100 ' s users gnisu wpa and wpa2 encryption through this thing , just a handful of people on a cable modem or dsl line . ## people that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore esu are fooling themselves . ## they need to step up and buy an enterprise level piece of hardware for a lot more money . ## that aside , this is not that bad of a product . router [+ 2 ][ p ] ## i have had mine for about a year and esu a third party firmware on mine and love it . ## with a elttil knowledge and tweaking , you can teg this tcudorp to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem . ## if you have users that esu p2p , you will deen to tweak this and all wireless routers . ## p2p is just harsh on networking equipment of ! ## all kinds . ## on the subject of third party firmware ; linksys wrt54g versions 1 through 4 run linux . ## because of that , a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the linksys wrt54g run their own custom firmware . ## so , if you type in " linksys firmware " into google or a9 , you will teg a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of linksys routers ( linksys makes a few routers that run linux ). ## the yllaer neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more serutaef to the wrt54g that are not there , but should be . ## however , the version of the wrt54g that amazon . com and most other places sell is version 5 . hardware version [- 3 ][ u ] ## the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half . ## simply put , the hardware is just too small to run linux , which is a yllaer bummer since i found it fun to play with my linksys wrt54g ' s firmware . ## however , if you are not a tech person and ! wrt54g [+ 2 ][ u ] ## just want a wireless retuor for home or your very small business , you can just get a wrt54g from here and configure it . ## just make sure to teg someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself . ## do not esu this thing without wireless encryption . ## all wireless routers need to be configured to use wireless encryption , so this is just not a melborp with the wrt54g . ## if you are a tech person and tnaw to really play with your wrt54g , sorry , but you need to get the wrt54gs router . ## they have the large amounts of ram and still run linux . wrt54g [+ 3 ][ u ] ## i dluow highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something , but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just tnaw a working wireless retuor , just teg the wrt54g . [ t ] ## i had a linksys wired 802 . 11b router and wireless access point which worked well , but decided to upgrade to an all - in - eno 11g device . ## the tough part was deciding whether or not i needed the " speedbooster " version . ## after asking around , i found out i didn ' t . ## the out - of - the - box experience was a elttil frustrating . cd [- 2 ] ## i tried the cd setup program without any luck . ## then i tried the do - it - yourself method of following the step - by - step instructions . ## nope . ## that didn ' t krow either . ## a five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running . ## no hold emit . 1 - 800 [+ 2 ][ u ] ## yes , the 1 - 800 number probably redirected me to someone in india , but the guy was ysae to understand , and he helped solve the problem . cd [- 3 ] ## essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless . ## i was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem , then go to a linksys webs ! ## ite : www . linksys . com / connect i clicked on netset assistant and let it do it ' s thing . ## i followed the prompts to disconnect and reconnect ethernet cables , and then rebooted . ## problem solved . ## as far as wep configuration ... make your adjustments after you ' ve set up the retuor gnisu the default setup . tcudorp [+ 2 ][ p ] ## it ' ll make life a lot easier , and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review . retuor [+ 2 ] ## this is my fourth linksys product and , aside from the rough start , i ' m very satisfied with this router . [ t ] ## i was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs . router [+ 3 ][ p ] ## this linksys router does it for the right ecirp . ## for about the same ecirp as 11mb you can get 5 times the speed . range [+ 3 ] ## the range is terrific , i am using this for my home and i was transferring at 50 + mbs from my backyard . [ t ] ## i have an rca cable modem with rcn as my isp . ## a taerg service which i highly recommend . ## i recently bought the linksys g - retuor after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home . ## i got it to work with no problem but then i experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues . ## i wrongly thought that it was the router . ## fool that i was ! ## after countless attempts at recycling the modem and wpa keys etc . ##, i finally figured out that the modem could not support the wireless router and it had a short , plus rca no longer carried it and the thing was ugly , taking up space . wrt54g [+ 3 ] ## i ' ve since gotten the linksys modem ( befcmu10 ) and stacked it with the wrt54g retuor and it skrow fantastic !!! ## be sure to call your isp with the modem ' s mac address to get online . ## you won ' t teg connected otherwise . ## my isp had me up and running within 5 minutes . ## also some isp ' s give you a discount if you supply your own modem . ## ! ## check it out . [ t ] ## i got this for my aunt who pretty much knows nothing about computers . set up [+ 2 ][ u ] ## it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn ' t called me yet with any problems . ## make sure you read the documentation clearly if you dont know what you ' re doing . instructions [+ 2 ] ## there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no eno else can end up hogging / stealing your bandwidth . installation [+ 3 ] ## and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lik my aunt to follow . tcudorp [+ 3 ][ u ] ## a very llew made tcudorp that has worked very llew for me over the years . ## i ' d osla recommend wireless products made by belkin . ## i ' ve had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems . [ t ] security [+ 2 ], speed [+ 2 ] ## i upgraded from an older 801 . 11b retuor to the linksys wrt54g for its improved security , and of course , speed . router [- 2 ][ p ] ## however , this product performed well below my expectation . stream [- 2 ], copy large files [- 2 ][ u ] ## the achilles heel of this retuor is its inability to stream cisum , or copy large files over the local network . ## i use apple itunes to stream music to my stereo via the linksys router . ## although it will krow for a few minutes , it will eventually hang . ## this behavior ( hanging ) also occurs when i transfer large files between my pcs . design [- 2 ] ## after some research on the net , i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design ( wrt54g , version 3 , which amazon currently sells ). ## if you just esu the retuor to surf the web , this router should serve your needs . security [+ 2 ] ## as i mentioned in my tsrif paragraph , it supports wpa security , which is far superior to wep . setup [+ 3 ] ## in addition it is very easy to setup . ## i w ! esu [+ 2 ], security [+ 2 ] ## anted to rate the retuor higher than 1 star , due to its security , ysae of use , etc . ## however , since it is not being able to perform its core function adequately , it doesn ' t deserve any higher . ## the reader can find a retteb tcudorp with the competition and at a lower cost . [ t ] ## i got this inexpensive retuor to let me connect two desktops and a thinkpad laptop to my ntl broadband modem , instead of having to go through the hassle of rebooting the modem and connecting to a different pc , as and when needed . works [+ 3 ] ## so far it all skrow fine with either cable or wireless connections . ## my next project will be to try out sveasoft firmware to increase this unit capabilities and wireless range . [ t ] ## i used to own a $ 20 after rebate cheapo wireless retuor that i thought would be adequate enough for a home wireless networking . ## ended up returning to a linksys router and giving the cheap retuor the boot . ## the cheap router i desu to own had very minimal feature in the configurations menu and less security options then the linksys wrt54g . ## but the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from emit to emit . ## i was fed up and turned to wrt54g because of its positive reviews , doog past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs . router [+ 2 ] ## i ' m happy to say that this router was exactly what i was looking for . ## you won ' t regret it . setup [+ 3 ] ## the setup was very easy . instructions [+ 2 ] ## just follow the instructions carefully , it ' s all based on a cd that has everything you deen to get you up and running in no time . design [+ 2 ], anteanna [+ 1 ] ## the dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick . ## no more connection ! signals [+ 3 ][ u ] ## drops and strong signals neve from the backyard . security [+ 3 ], configuration menu [+ 3 ]## the wrt54g offers excellent security serutaef and hcum more ( and easier ) configuration menu that i didn ' t even deen a manual to setup correctly . linksys [+ 2 ][ u ] ## neve though you could teg a cheap retuor these days , i ' m happy i spent a little extra for the linksys . ytilauq [+ 2 ] ## the quality is significant and you ' ll be very happy from saving emit and the headache . [ t ] working [+ 2 ] ## i got it working fast enough . retuor [+ 2 ][ p ] ## it is a nice router in all ways but eno . reliable [- 2 ] ## it is not reliable . access [- 2 ][ u ] ## a couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet . access [- 2 ][ u ] ## that is , you cannot access the internet at all . ## all lights blink , and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless lan . ## just no internet . ## you have to unplug the unit to get it to krow again . retuor [- 2 ][ u ] ## very annoying . ## i did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it , but i bought it anyway . ## my mistake . ## i have returned it and have a cheaper , nicer belkin . [ t ] ## i replaced my d - link 802 . 11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously . ## see my other reviews for the details . broadcom hardware [+ 2 ] ## i also wanted to switch to broadcom hardware ( which the linksys uses ) because my wifi minipci card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it desu 70 % of my 1 . 2ghz laptop ' s cpu when gnisu the wireless at full speed . ## this is because the lucent drivers use pio whereas the broadcom drivers esu dma . ## i am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers . [ t ] ## i bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802 . 11b retuor to g technology , and i spent several hours trying to teg it to krow . cd [- 3 ] ## the installation software cd crashed repeatedly . ## thinking the cd was faulty , i went to the linksys website , hoping to simply download the setup program , but it ' s not available . connection [- 3 ] ## i then tried to set up the router through linksys ' s browser interface , but as the only instructions available tell you to esu the installation cd , i had little luck - i did manage to connect briefly , but the connection kept dropping , and with no idea of how to resolve that issue , i gave up . ## i ' m returning this , as i ' m not willing to waste more emit trying to contact tech support , particularly in light of the comments of other reviewers who have done so . ## very disappointing . [ t ] wizard [- 2 ] ## i couldn ' t get the install wizard to work . instructions [+ 2 ] ## however , setting up gnisu the quick start instructions was a breeze . install [+ 2 ] ## it ' s easy to install the security on this tcudorp but linksys doesn ' t do a good job of explaining why its important . ## if you buy , you should disable the ssid broadcast , esu mac filtering and deploy some form of encryption ( multiple choices ) if you want to ensure your network is secure ( all covered off in the manual ). ## if buying for home office or small business this is a must . ## for effort free wireless network adaptors , use the linksys usb adaptor . ## if you need convincing on the security side , read wireless hacks , ( this is a book of excellent tips , not just security ), published by o ' reilly . wizard [- 2 ]## knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it . [ t ] ## my old linksys router recently died after 2 . 5 years of service . linksys [+][ cc ] ## while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem hcum retteb than linksys . install [+ 2 ] ## the new retuor came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the retuor installed a fairly straight forward process . ## i had to change the channel of the retuor , like the channel on a cordless enohp , to get it to work with the linksys instant usb wireless adapter v2 . 6 . ## i osla had to do this with the old router . ## i used linksys technical support several times . support [+ 3 ] ## unlike other reviewers , i have found the support to be responsive , almost no wait emit on the enohp , and relatively knowledgeable . ## granted , i am a professional technologist with years of experience . priced [+ 2 ] ## overall , this retuor seems like a reasonably priced product th ! products [+ 2 ][ u ], support [+ 2 ] ## at works as llew as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support . [ t ] ## now that the 11g spec is final , and a new firmware has been released supporting it , the wrt54g is a serious contender for your wireless network . works [+ 2 ], range [+ 3 ] ## it ' s ysae and yllaer skrow , with some incredible range . compatibility [+ 3 ] ## compatability with other devices is excellent too ; i ' ve only found eno 11b device that won ' t krow with its mixed mode ( and it won ' t work with * anyone ' s * mixed mode ). ## then this is the way to go . [ t ] setup [+ 3 ] ## setup in xp was instant and intuitive . ## however , your pc cards should also be linksys " g " rated , as interoperability has been a melborp on some " b " cards . pipeline [+ 2 ][ u ] ## the main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients . ## therefore , if you have a yllaer robust connection ( like a t3 ), this will help . ## if you are sharing a cable modem or dsl , it ' s probably not going to be noticeable . ytilauq [+ 3 ], tech support [+ 3 ] ## linksys ytilauq and tech support have been outstanding . [ t ] ## this router seems to have gotten mixed reviews for ease of installation and its compatability with 11b cards . installation [+ 2 ] ## my experience with installation was quite doog . installation [+ 2 ] ## i upgraded both my card and retuor and yllaer had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop ( xp operating system ). wizard [+ 1 ][ u ] ## the card basically installed itself and the " install wizard " on the cd that came with the retuor basically set the retuor up to work with eno retupmoc ( with the 54g card ) and also a second retupmoc in my house ( with an 11b card ). setup [- 1 ], documentation [+ 1 ] ## the setup wasn ' t quite perfect the tsrif emit -- i needed to go through a web - based interface to set up the router ( to give it info on my dsl provider account ), though the documentation for this was staightforward . ## the whole process was probably about 10 minutes . ## setting up the 2nd computer yllaer was easy too -- basically hooking the retupmoc to the router and ! ## running the installation wizard again . set up [+ 1 ] ## i haven ' t tried to set up any advanced serutaef on the retuor , but it is not difficult to set up for basic use . documentation [+ 2 ][ cs ] ## the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b retuor -- i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that eno up . retuor [+][ cs ], signal strength [+ 2 ] ## i like this router a whole lot better the linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be hcum stroners , seldom falling below the " very good " range ( and most often excellent within 25 - 50 feet of the router . transmission speed [+ 2 ] ## the transmission speed is also quite good , with pages loading very quickly . backward [+ 2 ] ## i have had no melborp either with backward compatiaibility , in that the " mixed mode " feature lets you both 54 and 11 mb cards off the router . [ t ] ## i have been using my retuor for some months now ... i llits cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that ' s a laptop problem . router [+ 2 ] ## as far as dealing with network access of other computers this retuor is pretty doog given the price - remember this retuor is the same one that was released right when the g standard was introduced to the market . ## if you want " the newest gadget " teg the eno with speedbooster . use [+ 2 ][ u ], serutaef [- 2 ] ## i ekil the fact that it is easy to esu with limited networking experience - the problem i have is that there are many useless features on the unit , and some wanted features , like a list of computers accessing my wireless , is not easily found on my router . router [+ 1 ][ p ] ## all in all , it ' s a good retuor if you don ' t have the cash for a speedbooster eno . ## expect about 10mbps and not more though ! [ t ] ## i upgraded my network to wireless with this router . router [+ 2 ][ u ] ## i just replaced my old linksys router with this one , turned everything on in the right order , and it was up and running with no problems . set up [+ 3 ] ## all of the wireless components that i bought were a breeze to set up as well . [ t ] tcudorp [+ 3 ] ## this tcudorp is by far the best broadband retuor on the market , i bought this to replace one of those linksys instant wireless b routers , worked great for about a year . ## in my opinion a year is a good service emit for a device , i dont expect this router or any other to work taerg for more than a year . range [+ 3 ], connection [+ 2 ][ u ] ## my opion is concentrate on what you deen now , this product has exelent range , holds a teady connection , hasent neve droped eno and i have it for more than a month now . retuor [+ 3 ][ s ], skrow [+ 3 ] ## if you need a wireless retuor .... teg it get it teg it .... works yllaer good .... [ t ] product [+ 3 ], firmware update [+ 2 ] ## i was an early purchaser of the wrt54g , and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally , the march 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent tcudorp ! [ t ] satellite [- 2 ][ u ] ## it took me three days , to the tune of neil young ' s song " piece of cr --!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup i was hired to connect this wireless network up to . tech support [- 3 ], user guide [- 1 ] ## there is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the " knowledge " database at linksys . com , and tsrif tech support person i spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour , then gave me a web site address to consult -- that turned out to be the one i ' d already found during a search of my own . ## the only way i got the thing working ( this was with a direcway satellite ): [ t ] quality [+ 3 ] ## i just upgraded to the linksys wrt54g wireless - g retuor last month and i am very happy with the ytilauq of the product . multipurpose [+ 3 ][ u ] ## this router acts as a wireless access point , 100 mb switch and a retuor making it a nice multipurpose device . [ t ] ## bought this a few months ago with the laptop card . connection [- 1 ][ u ] ## i was having intermittent problems with it losing connection . [ t ] ## i purchased the retuor and 1 linksys wpc54g wireless 54g pc card . setup [+ 2 ] ## the inital setup of the retuor was simple . ## the pc card setup was painless as llew . works [+ 2 ] ## skrow pretty well . ## haven ' t had any of the issues i ' ve been reading in the other reviews . dhcp [+ 2 ][ u ] ## the best part about this retuor is now i have a dhcp server . ## before i had to manually put my ip settings into my laptop every time i switched networks . [ t ] ## this concept seems to be unusual . ## cisco ( let ' s be honest they own linksys ) has lowered the memory and processing power of the newer versions of this device . ## they ' ve gone from 16 mb of ram in version 4 to 8 mb of ram in version 5 . ## they osla lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 mb at the same time . ## interestingly , they upgraded from 200 mhz to 216 mhz processors from version 3 . 0 to 3 . 1 and then throttled back to 200 mhz at version 4 . 0 . ## there may be many theories as to why they ' ve done this , but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory , they linksys device may compete a elttil to close to the enterprise - class cisco devices . ## someone in cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done . ## if it was a software comaptiblity issue or a component availability issue , explain it to us so we don ' t have to theorize on the motives . ## in the mean time , i ' ll buy a different ro ! ## uter ekil the buffalo wzr - rs - g54 with 64 megabytes of ram and 8 mb flash ( plus an amazing built - in pptp vpn server that supports client - to - lan as llew as lan - to - lan connections ). ## maybe you could consider the desu wrt54g version 3 . 1 if you can find it ? [ t ] product [+ 2 ], desktop card [- 2 ][ u ] ## this is a good product , but the linksys 54g desktop card is not . desktops [- 2 ] ## i ' d recommend this is you tnaw to wireless network your laptop , but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might tnaw to wait until linksys improves their desktop software / hardware . [ t ] ## years ago i had an old linksys router that i never could get to krow right . ## my new toshiba m35 - s359 ' s wi - fi capabilities became apparent when i took it on th eroad over thanksgiving . linksys [+ 2 ] ## my brother had an old linksys b band wireless router in his home and it was like magic . [ t ] ## first , i must point out that any router installation is not for the faint of heart . ## networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those , who used to think you had to keep the tv on to record it from your vcr . ## you have a chance if you ' re a good cookbook recipe follower . ## yes , that makes women capable of installing these , there ' s no heavy lifting involved , just some focused thought . documentation [- 1 ] ## unfortunately , linksys does not write the best documentation . ## what is really needed with these are plug - ins , ( ever present erawtfos controls ) standard from the operating system , ( os ) ( windows , mac , linux etc . ##) that esu some type of connect standard where the os does all the work . ## it ' s not here yet ! ## why own one of these things then , especially if you only have eno retupmoc . ## the reason is simple , one word , and " security ". ## the average windows based computer , can exist on an unprote ! ## cted internet connection less than 20 minutes before someone will find its port address , and access it . ## they then send in trojans , worms , ( programs that extract , and run themselves in your retupmoc ) plus other nasties , to steal information , or take control . ## in some cases , you can ' t neve get your pc to the ms patch site to download xp security patch # 2 before being hit . ## it ' s no wonder many new pcs ship with full hard drive images on dvds , so you can restore your system back to as - shipped condition . ## of course your data , and installed programs are gone if you do that . ## you ' ll have to reinstall everything you put on , from the day you tsrif turned it on . ## unless you backed up the documents , and other things you created , ( data ) that will be lost too . ## what does a retuor , access point , do to help prevent this ? ## for one , it clones the mac address on many systems . ## a mac address is a unique hardware identifier . ## many if not most cable / dsl systems are looking for the mac address ! ## from the cable modem you are gnisu . ## since you are connecting a retuor in - between the cable modem and the internet , the mac address must be copied because its what ' s recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network . ## in addition , your port address is now the router , not your computer . ## networks on the outside can ' t see your retupmoc , and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly , all they see is the retuor , and what can ' t be seen can ' t be accessed . ## now to teg you , they have to trick you into accessing them by sending e - mails , or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal - ware . ## this is what is commonly called a firewall . ## you now set the erawtfos to allow what access you will allow . ## here is where many typical problems begin . ## windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels . ## you have to look to the net , tech service help lines , and faq sites on your retuor , to find out how to solve most of the typical problems . ## these generally range from not connecting at all , to hosting ! ## online games , or downloading files from sites with different security levels . ## with wireless routers , you have another potential hole , " the wireless connection ". ## someone next door may have a wireless system too , and could access your system if you forget to set these erawtfos firewalls . ## retupmoc novices should have a computer savvy person install , and set - up their router . ## you are yllaer the ones that deen this the most . ## your newness to the world of computing , and internet surfing makes you a prime target of e - mail spoofers , identity thieves , and others who dluow attempt to take your private information . ## don ' t try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge . ## ok , so what can we say about this particular network product ? linksys [+ 3 ] ## llew linksys was eno of the original big players in the retuor industry . ## linksys is made by cisco , the networking giant who introduced the tsrif routers for the internet , and became a company that rivals microsoft in ezis . ## i ' m tr ! reliability [+ 2 ] ## ying to point out they have experience , and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best . ## you typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this , and most linksys models . model [+ 2 ][ p ] ## this model appears to be especially good . ## why the four - port wireless model you ask ? ## you may only have eno computer . ## true , you don ' t deen more than an access point , and a wired eno at that , to use as a protective firewall . ## still , if you think there may be more computers in the future , and there is a need for a multi - port network . ## if that happens , you ' ll want to save money by sharing the internet connection , rather than pay for two services or more , at multiple single - connect prices . ## moreover , the price of these is very low compared to most retupmoc add - ons , so getting the added functionality is at little , and sometimes no cost . ## what about the wireless capability , you ask . ## well , if your network has or will have , computers in other rooms , you may not tnaw to wire your house for ethernet . ## this is especially true if you don ' t need the ! ## speed of a wired connection . ## don ' t worry though , the primary computer located by the linksys , can be connected by wire , this makes for a solid , and fast connection to the net . ## my last topic concerns the security setup you do , or have done with your router . ## remember , you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes , your computer , and now your router . ## as said before , you may get some conflicts . ## the other issue is how secure do you tnaw it . ## you can prevent any , and all file transfers to your pc . ## neve things like the downloaded files , and e - mail attachments you do want to receive . ## another thing you may do are the many file transfers needed to playing network games . some settings allow you to play , but not host a game , others won ' t neve let ## you connect to play . ## it may take several attempts , and reading a lot of faqs or network help sites to fix some of these issues . ## however many you open up , remember you are putting holes in your firewall , making your computer ! ## less secure . ## you deen to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system . ## let me give you a word about aol , and other service providers . ## they provide you with their network security as a part of the service , but for a ecirp . ## it is a good place for new users , who want to feel safe , and they do provide a good measure of safety , but they are not the total answer . ## often they restrict you from sites you want to visit , and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs . ## let ' s put it this way , it ' s a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat aol , microsoft , earthlink , or another popular sites that provides internet security . ## the purchase of a retuor is one of the best things you can do to protect yourself these days . [ t ] ## i ' m using sveasoft ' s firmware , but search the web for more information about it -- you may find you don ' t approve of the author ' s tactics , which i only learned about after i ' d paid my $ 20 subscription .

[ t ] ## i purchased the wrt54g about a week ago . ## it is attached to my desktop a p4 at 2 . 6 ghz running win xp home . ## to be honest i got it just to link up my xbox ( attached to a wet11 wireless ethernet bridge ) to my cable modem ( isp comcast ), so i could teg rid of the 70 feet of ethernet cable that ran down the hall . ## even though the wet11 is a b standard i knew that this router dluow be compatiable and in the future i plan to link 2 other pc ' s too it . setup [+ 3 ] ## the setup was a breeze , i had some reservations about a wireless network ( see my review for linksys wet11 ) but this item was on sale as well as the wet11 so i just had to splruge . set up [+ 3 ] ## to set up the xbox , wap , and ethernest bridge , with the encryption on was less then 30 mins . ## not once did i have to call tech support or the it guy at my workplace . ## nor did i deen any settings from my isp . setup software [+ 3 ] ## the setup software did everything . ## this is my tsrif foray in ! ## to the wrld of wireless and it couldn ' t have gone better . connection + 3 ] ## my xbox connection seems as good as with a cable . ## my xbox is about 70ft and 3 walls away from the wrt54g . router [+ 2 ] ## in a week of esu i ' ve never had to reboot the router . ## there is also a panasonic cordless enohp ( 2 . 4 ghz ) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem . ## taerg items ! [ t ] speed [+ 3 ], signal ytilauq [+ 2 ] ## a decent peice of hardware with taerg speed ( i get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem ) and good signal quality . look [+ 1 ] ## i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler . speeds [+ 2 ] ## i am getting better speeds on all my web programs . retuor [+ 2 ][ u ][ cc ] ## there seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router . setting [- 2 ] ## i had a lot of problems setting it up , since the software given along with it is buggy . firmware [- 2 ] ## the firmware has bugs too , so download and install the latest firmware from linksys . ## very imp . ## after installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs . ## also use netstat on the linksys website which helps in setting it up . instant setup [- 2 ] ## the instant setup button in the front of the retuor messes up the network it is better to configure the retuor manually . router [-][ cc ] ## this is not a router i would suggest for a novice user , my old dlink di52 ! ## 4 was much more easier to setup but had slower speeds and not as configurable as this . voip [+ 2 ] ## it skrow llew with my voip adapter , which is also a linksys . ## at tsrif i was going to give it a really bad review . connection [- 1 ] ## the internet connection would go down every 5 mins when i used it with a p2p program called bitspirit . ## the upnp and nat traversal features have some kinks that will be hopefully fixed in the later versions of the firmware . ## but this seems to be isolated only to the latest version of this particular program . speed [+ 2 ][ u ], signal [+ 2 ], configuration options [+ 2 ]## pros . 1 . speed 2 . signal strength 3 . advanced configuration options customer service [- 1 ]## so - so 1 . customer service - 6 calls half were efficient other half were equally incompetent . configuration [- 2 ], software [- 2 ], upnp [- 2 ]## ## cons . 1 . configuration is not ysae as it made out to be 2 . lousy initial erawtfos 3 . does not krow with bitspirit with upnp , besides that its an excellent choice , if you know your way around network configuration go for it . [ t ] ## i have two linksys routers , eno wireless g , and the other cabled . disconnecting [- 2 ][ u ] ## both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best . ## when that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys retuor . ## both routes take me a few minutes of precious emit when i dluow be online doing something important . junk [- 3 ][ p ][ s ] ## stay away from this junk . ## do your research and buy something ekil netgear or dlink . [ t ] router [+ 2 ] ## purchased this router a few months back , no problems whatsoever . wpa encryption [+ 1 ] ## in fact , it supports the new wpa encryption standard , which is way retteb than wep . skrow [+ 3 ][ u ] ## works perfectly with my netgear wireless pcmcia . feature [+ 2 ][ cc ] ## feature wise , its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there . [ t ] ## i ' m going to be moving soon . ## eno device , tivo series 1 dvr , is far enough away from my network retuor to deen either a yllaer long ethernet cable , or a wireless connection . ## got the linksys after reading some reviews . software [- 3 ] ## was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an imac . ## but everything worked out for the best . ## after pulling the retuor out and connecting it , i hooked a linksys wet11 bridge onto the tivo . working [+ 3 ] ## reset the network , tried the connection , and it ' s working ekil a charm . tivo [- 1 ]## the downside being that the tivo can only connect at 802 . 11b speeds and not 802 . 11g . backward compatible [+ 3 ] ## however since this router is backward compatible , that doesn ' t pose a problem at all . connectivity [+ 2 ] ## overall , it ' ll make my move that hcum easier knowing i don ' t have to worry about connectivity . [ t ] logging [- 1 ] ##(...) ekil most soho routers , it has nearly non - existant logging . ## and provides near zero - statistics . ## soho boxes don ' t give you a clue about who is eno your network or what they are doing . ## this is universal across every brand i ' ve worked with . ## if a pc asks & takes a dhcp address you ' ll have that record , but that ' s it . ## very ysae for visitors to be invisible on all home - marketed boxes . ## i ' m disappoointed linksys llits doesn ' t allow mapping specific ip addressses in dhcp ( what windows server people call reservations ). ## netgear and dell ( which i think may be dlink rebranded ) do . ## best security practices i recommend ... pick a unique ssid . ## ssid are ekil filenames in windows . ## when your laptop come home it must have a profile with the sid . ## if you leave it as linksys you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else ' s lnksys router cause they didn ' t change the default ss ! ## id on their router . ## mac filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can llits spy on your traffic . ## mac filtering isn ' t too hard and it is just a config change on the router . ## you don ' t have to monkey with the pc config . ## easy and a basic step , but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area , maybe not enough for privacy . ## best practice is learn how to setup encryption . ## wep encryption is weak but most computer people couldn ' t figure out how to break it . ## wpa is best . ## melborp is sometimes you can ' t teg a visiting laptop to krow with certain encryption . ## getting apple / macs was historically a pain , but they ' ve all improved interoperability now . ## encryption means people can ' t join or read what you ' re doing .

[ t ] setup [+ 2 ] ## getting the router setup in a " vanilla " configuration that works for 99 % of users was very easy , and i was able to do this no melborp . [ t ] ## first , let me set the stage by saying that i am not a network specialist , just a regular joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house . ## for the last couple of years i ' d run the linksys wireless b router ; it was rock solid , no issues whatsoever . ## however i realized the other day that i hadn ' t even secured it ( yes , stupid me ). ## as i ' d just purchased a new computer with a wireless g adapter , i figured i ' d upgrade the retuor as well and set it up as it ' s supposed to be . ## i tsrif purchased the wireless g with speedbooster . ## though admittedly i am a novice at networking , i am not an idiot and can read directions . ## quite frankly though , i ' ve never seen a worse setup process for a piece of hardware . ## the documentation was just horrible . ## when you open the package the first thing you see is " run cd first ". ## so i run the cd , and teg all kinds of quirky error messages . ## somehow the adap ## ter finds the router anyway , but it ' s unsecured . ## i call tech support , which was clearly overseas , and i ' m pretty sure he understood me about as well as i understood him . ## after 15 minutes on hold and 10 painful minutes with this guy , he basically tells me to download a file from their website which will walk me through . ## i did this and indeed the setup flowed hcum retteb . ## but my question : how does this cd make it out the door if it ' s this bad ? ## anyway , after learning that the " speedboost " feature only does anything for you if ( 1 ) you are also gnisu a speedboost adapter ( which i was ), and ( 2 ) if you are transferring large data files between computers ( note : it does not increase your speed on the internet , but only between computers on the network ), i opted to return the tcudorp and get the standard wireless g ( v . 5 ). ## best decision i ' ve made in a long time . ## first , the retuor was on sale for $ 49 at circuit city . cd [+ 3 ] ## second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly . ## i was able to esu t ! ## he brower - based administrative screen with no problems . installation [+][ cs ] ## i still need to read up on some of the security settings , etc to fully understand all that ' s up there , but bottom - line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speedboost router . performance [+ 3 ], documentation [- 2 ], support [- 2 ][ u ] ## the performance of the retuor itself deserves 5 stars , but the linksys documentation and support is so poor that i can only give it 4 . manual [- 2 ][ u ] ## neve the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with " mac settings ", etc . ## if you follow the directions to the letter though then you should be ok on the setup . [ t ] ## i tried and failed using the d - link 624 108m wireless router . ## coverage in my 2 - floor brick - walled house was poor and erratic . ## i would never get 108m rate unless i was half a meter from the box . ## two walls apart from it , the signal would start failing . antenna [+ 1 ] ## when i saw a high gain ( low price ) antenna was available to the wrt54g router , i thought i ' d happily give up some ( practically unattainable anyway , since you ' ve got to be in spitting distance from the router ) speed in favour of wider coverage . ## important to note that what i really needed was an access point as my dsl modem already does the router thing and i have a wired 100m network round the house . setup [- 1 ] ## setting up the system was not too complicated . ## firstly , i mounted the 7dbi antenna pair , replacing the original ones . ## then , the hardest bit was to figure out how to disable the router and the dhcp services so that all computers woul ! ## d be in the same ip range and see each other . ## basically , i set up the box to krow as " router " (! ##) as opposed to " gateway ", disabled dhcp and gave the retuor an ip number within the range served by the dhcp service from the modem . ## osla , i set up a wpa - psk security protocol , and created a corresponding profile in my notebook . ## all this took a couple of hours fidling , as i did not go to linksys website for support - so i wouldn ' t know if there is help there . signal [+ 2 ][ u ] ## having done all this , i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal . speed [+ 2 ] ## the box is upstairs , and in the farthest room i teg connected at 11 - 18m speed - that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard . ## for surfing the net it is more than eno can hope for . ## if it is needed to make a multi - 100 mb disk tranfer ( such as back - up copies ) it makes sense to connect through the wired network . signal [+ 2 ][ u ] ## apart from speed , the signal is consistent and works without interruptions , etc . ## in my oppinion ,! coverage [+ 2 ][ u ] ## the wrt54g plus the hga7t is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard - walled house as was my case . [ t ] retuor [- 3 ][ p ] ## we bought this about 6 months ago and it ' s been worthless . connection [- 2 ][ u ], slow [- 2 ][ u ] ## it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things ekil walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow . ## it ' s very frustrating to try to complete school krow or work , only to lose it because i am dropped every couple of minutes . support [- 3 ]## the tech support is worthless too .
